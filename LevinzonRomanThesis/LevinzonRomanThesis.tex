\chapter{Introduction}

\appname\ is a combination of a note-taking service and a social network. Main purpose of the app is help users memorize different piecies  of information and make it easy this information easy to exchange with other users.
To allow this, user will be able to create notes, that will act a single information piece and stored in distinct sets: Notebooks. User will be able to participate in different challenges or tests based on one his/her notebooks and help other users by sharing and exchanging it. Whole application can be split into following sections:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Library Management
		\item Shareable Content
		\item Tests \& Challenges
		\item User Management
	\end{itemize}

\chapter{Analysis}

This chapter contains \appname\ application analysis with the goal to identify requirements and how it is compared with its rivals

// TODO Component diagram

\section{System description}
 \appname\ system follows client-server software architecture. Server part is presented by REST API thats is developed using Spring framework. Client part consists of  client applications for several platforms: Android, iOS and Web. Main task of this thesis is to deliver an Android application. iOS  application is developed as a part subject called BI-IOS and hence, has some limitations in its implementation. Web client is being developed alongside the Android one is serves as Admin Panel for the server which allows to modify certain data without dealing with the server directly.
 
 
 
 The detailed structure of the Android client structure and its connection with other components are presented in the component diagram bellow. It will be connected with Facebook SDK and Google Auth SDK to provide options for user to login and some minimal setup of Firebase SDK to enable analytics and crash reporting functionality 


\section{Domain Description}
Class diagram bellow represents Domain Model of the application, it provides visual representation of Entities and relations between them. Design is based on the entities used on server-side

\begin{figure}[t]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Domain}
\end{figure}

\subsection{User}
	User entity represents someone who have completed registration flow using one of the client app. This entity contains such properties as: firstName, lastName, email, password, university. Due to the fact, that \appname\ provides several ways for user to authorize, some of the properties will either come from the user's input or from the 3rd party API ( Google or Facebook ).

	
\subsection{Note}
	Note represent a single piece of information. It consists of two properties: title and content. These can be described as term and defenition or question and answer. Every note must be assigned to one of the notebooks, hence theres a 1:N relation
\subsection{Notebook}
	Notebook is one of the main entities used in the application flow, and  can be created by an authenticated user. Soul purpose of the Notebook is to store Notes and serve as a source for Shared Notebook. Properties name and color are used to help users distinct between different Notebooks
	
	
\subsection{University}
University represents school, where User can assign himself as a student during registration flow. It is used to unite users from the same schools, so they could faster find content they are looking for.

\subsection{Published Notebook}
Published Notebook represents a shareable content. It can be created by user, based on one of his/her notebooks by providing some additional details:
name, optional description,  Topic and optional set of Tags. All these details are later used for Search flow to optimize searching results.

\subsection{Published Note}
Published Note represent the note inside of the Published Notebook and  contains the exact same properties as usual note

\subsection{Topic}
Topic represents main topic or subject of the Published Notebook. Topic consist of only one property: name
\subsection{Tag}
Tag is us short label thats attached to the Published Notebook. It is mainly  used to narrow the topic or school. Tag has only one property - it's actual value stored as name

\subsection{Comment}
Users can comment on published notebooks. Most of the properties are assigned automatically, the only exception is content which is property that represents the body of the comment. All other properties are assigned automatically and can not be changed

\subsection{Quzlet - Key differences}

\textbf{Quizlet} is primarily used for learning languages, from where most of the limitations come from. Closest analogy to Notebook there is Study set with Terms inside. This makes it easier for tests generation, but limits user when he/she is trying to learn anything other than new words



\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Publishing}: Content publishing process is very different to what \appname\ is trying to achieve. All study sets are visible to other users by default, which makes it hard, if not impossible, to distinct between local and shared published set.
	\item \textbf{Importing}: Importing flow allows user to either copy or save study set to a specific folder. This flow may confuse some of the users, because only copy allows actually add set to user library and modify it. Saving study set to the specific folder only saves the link to it and splits library management in 2 parts.
	\item \textbf{Discovering:} This limitation comes from the fact, that Quizlet is an app for language learners. As a consequence, the only distinctions between Study sets are its name and a language. These are the only 2 options available for filtering published study sets.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cram - Key differences}
\textbf{Cram} is very similar to Quizlet but feels much more outdated in terms of UX and brings some sharing limitations to the table.

\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{Publishing:} Content publishing is similar to Quizlet - All sets are either visible by other users or not. Sharing a deep-link to a single study set was not functional at the time of writing this section
	\item \textbf{Discovering} Searching for content in Cram is even more limited comparing to Quizlet, only name of the study set is used
	\item \textbf{Importing} Library management here is splitted in 3 parts: User personal sets, Favourite sets, and Recently studied. When searching, there is no way to save published study set to personal library, it can only be automatically saved to Recent section, or manually added to Favourites. This makes it impossible to make local edits
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TinyCards - Key Differences}

\textbf{TinyCards} is app made by Duolingo, one of the biggest app for learning languages. TinyCard is meant to be more generic as it offers users to create custom study sets, often not limited to languages
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Importing:} Similar to Cram, it is not possible to edit the study set user have downloaded and saved to his library
		\item \textbf{Challenges:} Tests for user are generated automatically and there is no way to choose test type
	\end{itemize}
