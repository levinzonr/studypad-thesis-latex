\chapter{Introduction}

Each year, our smartphones get smarter and mobile applications become more advanced. The arrival of smartphones and mobile applications has completely changed our way of living, made it easier, and it is hard to come up with a single aspect of life, that has not been improved by one or the other application. They are everywhere: helping us to navigate in our neighbourhood, keeping us up to date with latest news, helping us to stay in touch with our loved ones, stay fit and healthy and more. In addition, some of the most popular applications tend to teach us something new.

Educational applications are very popular on both mobile platforms (iOS and Android). Many of them use a flash card system in the study process -- displaying small pieces of information one after another, so that the user can memorise it more efficiently. However, most of these services are fairly limited in terms of what they are trying to teach and some of the greatest  features are scattered across different applications and services. Using Android OS, today's most popular mobile platform, \appname\ wants to give its users freedom in what they can learn and give them proper tools to share, exchange and collaborate on study materials to make the education process even more easier.

\section{\appname\ Service}
\appname\ is a combination of a note taking service and a social network. It is intended for students and everyone who wishes to learn something new. The primary focus of \appname\ is on content creation, its sharing and discovery. 

The \appname\ project originated from several subjects on Faculty of Information Technology (FIT) in Czech Technical University (CTU). The first iteration of backend was introduced as a semestral project for subject Enterprise Java (BI-EJA), and subject Introduction to Android Development (BI-AND) had great influence on the first iteration of the Android Client. All of these components will be described more thoroughly in Chapter 1.
 

\appname\ core concepts are \textit{Notebooks} and \textit{Notes}. Notebook is simply a collection of notes united by one theme. This may be a subject in school, a language that you would like to learn or a set of questions that you could hear at a job interview. Note, in turn, is a part of the notebook and represents a single piece information that has a name and a content. It can also be interpreted as a question and answer or a term and its definition.
\\

Each user has his/her own space where they can create, store and edit notebooks and notes (hereafter \textit{Library}). All notebooks stored in the library can be used in various tests and exercises to help users to memorise its content.
\subsection{Sharing \& Collaboration}
\appname\ also allows users to easily share these notebooks with each other. Each notebook can be shared by creating a published version of it (hereafter Published Notebook),thereby making it available to everyone else for viewing and importing.
The publication process involves providing additional information about the notebook, including its name, an optional description, topic and optional tags that serve to narrow the topic. Everything the author has provided along with their school and language will then be used in the process of searching and filtering -- which will facilitate the search for the necessary materials. \appname\ also makes it possible to quickly share a notebook by sending a link, which will act as a deep-link, navigating the user directly to a Published Notebook.

The Author of the notebook reserves the right to make edits/corrections to the Published Notebook. Other users (hereinafter subscribers) in turn can save a Published Notebook to their library or suggest some changes or corrections to improve the content. By saving Published notebook to his/her library, the subscriber will be able to make any local changes as he/she sees fit and use it as normal. The Subscriber will be notified about any updates made to the Published Notebook so that he/she can apply the changes to his/her local version, however, any local changes will be deleted. The Author of the notebook, in turn, will be notified about latest suggestions and comments left by the subscribers.

\chapter{Analysis}
This chapter contains a \appname\ system description and analysis with the goal to identify requirements and how it is compares with its rivals


\section{System description}

The \appname\ system follows classic client-server software architecture. The server part is represented by the Spring Boot application, which communicates with its clients using REST API. The client part consists of client applications for several platforms: Android, iOS and Web. The Web client is being developed alongside the Android client to serve as an Admin Panel. The iOS client was developed within the subject Introduction to iOS Development (BI-IOS). The main task of this thesis is to deliver an Android OS client.

\subsection{User Roles}
Some of the use-cases, such as university creation, requires moderation. The simplest example is a university creation use-case. Though it is possible to submit new school/university in case user haven't found it, the name, that user has submitted has to be verified first and other details, like school location and translations should be updated. This is a main purpose of the Admin Panel and it will require an introduction of different user roles: User and Admin. 

The User role is a default one and will be assigned automatically to everyone who have completed the registration process. It will only be used in the client applications.
Admin role is the only one that have the access to the admin panel and an ability to view and modify certain data.

\subsection{\appname\ REST API}
\appname\ has its own REST API is represented by Spring Boot application. The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. 

\subsection{Android client}

The detailed structure of the Android client structure and how it is connected with other components is presented on the component diagram on figure \ref{fig:component}. 

 Android component will be divided into three layers: the Data layer, Domain Layer and Presentation layer. The Data layer is only responsible for downloading and storing data. The Business layer responsibility is to handle user interactions and converting downloaded data to something that presentation layer can present. Presentation layer is only responsible for displaying data. Android component will also connected be to Facebook SDK, Google Auth SDK and Firebase SDK to provide authentication options. Firebase SDK will also enable an analytics service, crash reporting and push notifications.

\end{figure}


\newpage
\section{Domain Description}
 The Class Diagram on figure \ref{fig:domain} represents the Domain Model of the application, it provides visual representation of Entities and relations between them. The Design is based on the entities used on server-side

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Domain}
  \caption{Domain Diagram}
  \label{fig:domain}
\end{figure}

 

\subsection{User}
	The User entity represents someone who has completed registration flow using one of the client applications or created manually (in case of Admin role). This entity contains such properties as: role, first name, last name, email address, password, university. Due to the fact, that \appname\ provides several ways for the user to authorise, some of the properties will either come from the user's input or from the 3d party API (such as Firebase).
	
\subsection{Note}
	Note represents a single piece of information. It consists of two properties: title and content. These can be described as term and definition or question and answer. Each note must be assigned to one of the notebooks, hence theres a 1:N relation.
\subsection{Notebook}
	Notebook is one of the main entities used in the application flow, and  can be created by an authenticated user.The soul purpose of the Notebook is to store Notes and serve as a source for a Published Notebook. Properties name and colour are used to help users distinguish between different Notebooks.
	
	
\subsection{University}
University represents a school, where the User can assign himself as a student during registration flow. It is used to unite users from the same school to make content searching easier. 

\subsection{Published Notebook}
Published Notebook represents a shareable content. It can be created by user, based on one of his/her notebooks by providing some additional details:
name, optional description,  topic and optional list of tags. All these details are later used in a searching flow to optimise results.

\subsection{Topic}
Topic represents the main topic or subject of the Published Notebook. Topic consist of only one property -- its name
\subsection{Tag}
Tag is a short label that is attached to the Published Notebook. It is mainly  used to narrow the topic or school. Tag has only one property -- its actual value stored as the name.

\subsection{Comment}
Users can comment on published notebooks. Most of the properties are assigned automatically, the only exception is content which is property that represents the body of the comment.

\newpage

\section{Existing solutions}

There are several services out there, whose goal is similar to \appname. However, most of the solutions are specialised for learning languages and have limited sharing and/or searching options. Each application/service will be reviewed separately and will include requirements and main processes comparison.

\subsection{StudyBlue}

\textbf{StudyBlue} not only partially shares a name with \appname\ but also a goal and a wide set of features. It is clearly on of the biggest rivals on the market and it is very important to determine what StudyBlue does right and what not. How most important \appname\ requirements are compared to the StudyBlue functionality can be seen on table \ref{tab:studyblue}

Notebooks here are called \textit{decks} and notes are represented by \textit{cards}. Moreover, all decks in StudyBlue are stored in specialised folders named Classes and Interests. Interest, as an entity, not only stores decks, but also unites them by a subject or a topic (eg Spanish, Literature). Being a student of the university, user can also create an interest, that will be connected to his/her school -- Class. Both Interests and Classes are split into 2 parts, shared space, where user can found all the decks created by other users, and personal space, where user can keep decks he/she created, saved or copied.

F17: Search Through The Published Notebooks                    & Present                                & Present                               \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Library management:} Main difference in library management comes with the fact, that each deck must be associated with an Interest or Class, moreover, it's not possible just to create deck, user have to create at least 2 cards first. Because of that, library management not only includes managing your decks and card, but also interests and classes. Everything user have saved or created, whether class, interest or a deck can be accessed via \textit{Backpack}.
	\item \textbf{Publishing:} Publishing process is quite different comparing to what \appname\ is trying to achieve. When creating a deck, user can choose whether he wants to make his/her deck visible for other users in this Class/Interest or to make it private. It is not possible to collaborate on a deck or suggest a change
	
	\item \textbf{Importing}: As mentioned before, user can save a deck from an existing Interest/Class to his personal space, but he would not be able to make any editions without making a copy.
	\item \textbf{Discovering:} The fact that all decks are either assigned to an Interest or a Class makes searching quite simple. User can search for deck, classes and users by its name.All these searching options are separated in the UI, so there is no way of combining them. Searching based on the Interest is also available, but user have to add this Interest to his/her \enquote{Backpack}
	\item \textbf{UI \&  UX}: StudyBlue has been in development roughly since 2009, and is for now, UI looks outdated and UX can be greatly improved. The most common UI issue here -- Inconsistent usage of UI elements styles.
\end{itemize}

 \subsection{Quizlet}
\textbf{Quizlet} is primarily used for learning languages, from where most of the limitations are coming from. Closest analogy to a Notebook here is a Study set with Terms inside. Being an application for language learners makes the process of generating different tests and quizzes quite easy, and this is where this application shines the most. Table \ref{tab:quizlet} shows requirements comparison between \appname\ and Quizlet

\begin{table}[H]

F13: Show Notes                                                & Present                                & Absent                                \\ \hline
F14: MathJax /ASCII Math support                               & Present                                & Absent                                \\ \hline
F16: Browse Through Published Notebooks                        & Present                                & Present                               \\ \hline
F17: Search Through The Published Notebooks                    & Present                                & Limited                               \\ \hline
F18-F21: User Commentaries                                     & Present                                & Absent                                \\ \hline
F27: User Suggestions                                          & Present                                & Limited                               \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Publishing}: Similar to StudyBlue, all Study Sets are visible to everyone else by default. However, Quizlet provides a wider variety of privacy options. Study Set can either be completely public, private or semi-private using a password protection. Password protection can also be used to allow certain users modify a study set
	\item \textbf{Importing}: Importing flow allows user to either copy or save study set to a specific folder. This flow may confuse some of the users, because only copy allows actually add a study set to user library and modify it. Saving study set to the specific folder only saves the link to it and splits library management in 2 parts.
	\item \textbf{Discovering:} This limitation comes from the fact, that Quizlet is an app for studying foreign  languages. As a consequence, the only distinctions between Study Sets are its name and its language. These are the only 2 options available when searching through study sets.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cram}
\textbf{Cram} is very similar to Quizlet but seems highly outdated in terms of UX/UI and brings some sharing limitations to the table. Table \ref{tab:cram} shows requirements comparison between \appname\ and Cram

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{Publishing:} Content publishing is similar to Quizlet -- All sets are either visible by other users or not. Sharing a deep-link to a single study set was not functional at the time of writing this section.
	\item \textbf{Discovering} Searching for content in Cram is even more limited comparing to Quizlet, only name of the study set is used
	\item \textbf{Importing} Library management here is split in 3 parts: User personal sets, Favourite sets, and Recently studied. When searching, there is no way to save published study set to personal library, however, it will be automatically saved to Recent section, or user can add it manually to Favourites. It is not possible to make any local editions.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{TinyCards}

\textbf{TinyCards} is an application made by Duolingo, one of the biggest app for learning languages. TinyCard is meant to be more generic as it offers users to create custom study sets, often not limited to languages. Table \ref{tab:tinycards} shows how \appname\ requirements are compared to TinyCards functionality 

\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Importing:} Similar to Cram, it is not possible to edit the study set user have downloaded and saved to his library
		\item \textbf{Challenges:} Tests are generated automatically and there is no way to choose test type

	\section{Android Platform}
Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, and is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Wear OS for wrist watches, each with a specialised user interface.

Since its inception several versions have been released, with the latest one being 9.0, codenamed \enquote{Pie}. Every new version provides new and improved APIs to work with and backward compatibility for applications running on older versions. Originally, the Support Libraries were used to provide backward compatibility while targeting newer versions. This was a case until AndroidX was introduced.
AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library. Like the Support Library, AndroidX ships separately from the Android OS and provides backwards-compatibility across Android releases. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\center
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{androidversions}
  \caption{Android Versions distribution}
  \label{fig:androidversions}
\end{figure}


When developing applications for Android, developer has to consider which OS versions application will support. Specifically, the minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion attributes  identify the lowest API level with which your application is compatible and the highest API level against which you've designed and tested your application. \appname\ will target the latest Android version available, with the minimal version set to 5.0, codenamed Android Lollipop. This will ensure high compatibility rate of 85\% and Material Design Support, which is one of non-functional requirements.

\section{Firebase}
Firebase is Google's mobile platform that helps to quickly develop high-quality applications and grow businesses. Firebase provides high number of services, some of which are a necessity in today's world of software development. \\\appname\ will be using following services:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Firebase Analytics} is a cost-free app measurement solution that provides insight into app usage and user engagement.
	\item \textbf{Firebase Cloud Messaging} Formerly known as Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform solution for messages and notifications for Android, iOS, and web applications, which as of 2016 can be used at no cost.
	\item \textbf{Firebase Auth} is a service that can authenticate users using only client-side code. It supports social login providers Facebook, GitHub, Twitter and Google (and Google Play Games). Additionally, it includes a user management system whereby developers can enable user authentication with email and password login stored with Firebase.
	\item \textbf{Crashlytics} Crash Reporting creates detailed reports of the errors in the app. Errors are grouped into clusters of similar stack traces and triaged by the severity of impact on app users.

\end{itemize}


\noindent While Firebase Analytics and Crash Reporting services are a great help while developing a mobile applications, Firebase Auth and FCM are essential for some of the functional requirements. 

Storing user credentials, and most importantly, storing it safely is not an easy task. With a little effort, Firebase Auth will handle everything related to user management, including access token generation and refreshment, and credentials storing and encryption.

Firebase Cloud Messages will enable push-notifications, which is a great way to communicate with users and introduce some real-time functionality to the application.

\chapter{Design}

This chapter describes how \appname\ will comply with its requirements. This includes reviewing of application UI \& UX standpoint and choice of applications architecture


\section{Wireframes}

\subsection{Navigation Principle}
How user will be able to navigate through your applications different screens and section is one of most important choices when developing a mobile applications. Material Design describes 3 types of navigation hierarchies that can be used for a top-level navigation

\begin{itemize}
	\item Bottom navigation bar -- Bottom navigation bars provide access to 2-5 top-level destinations on mobile devices. Their location, visibility, and persistence across screens allow quick pivoting between destinations.
	\item Navigation drawer -- Navigation drawers are appropriate for five or more top-level destinations, and can be used across device sizes for a consistent navigation experience.
	\item Tabs -- Tabs can be used at any level of an application's hierarchy to present two or more peer sets of data across screen sizes.
\end{itemize}

\appname\ application has 4 main independent sections: My Library, Sharing Hub, Challenges and Profile making the Bottom Navigation bar the perfect choice. It will enable quick and persistent navigation between different sections.

\subsection{Top-level sections}
Following application sections are used for top level navigation. They must provide access to application core functionalities



\textbf{My Library} section covers note-taking service part of the application. Its entry point contains a list of Notebooks and provides different actions related to the notebook management, such as: Notebook creation, edition, deletion and sharing. By clicking on one of the notebooks in the list, user will be transferred to the Notes subsection, that will contain a list of notes from this notebook. Like Notebooks section, Notes section covers all the note management related actions and interactions such as Note creation, edition and deletion.

\textbf{Sharing Hub} section features list of Published Notebooks. One of the main responsibilities of this section is to enable Searching \& Filtering flow. 

\textbf{Challenges} section serves as an entry point for setting up different tests based on the user notebooks

\textbf{Profile} sections provides various user-important information and allows user to modify them.
